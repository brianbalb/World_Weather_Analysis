Develop weather based itineraries and google map heatmaps for the imagniary app PlanMyTrip.

## Resources
Software: Python 3.6.9, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1

Project Overview:

1. For the new modifications to the PlanMyTrip app, I am asked to add more data using API access to the update the database so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker. 

2. In addition I was asked to add the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours so that customers can filter the quieres using input statements based on the temperature range; whether or not it is raining or snowing.

3. Finally, I created a directions layer Google map that shows the directions between multiple cities for travel.
